## Hey there 👋 I'm brunketa

Just another Full-Stack Developer trying to keep things clean, fast, and scalable — sometimes all at once.

2.5 years deep in enterprise apps - enough to have strong opinions, not enough to be bitter.

If you're here looking for polished public projects — don't.
Old stuff is a war crime, new stuff lives in private repos where the chaos is better contained.
